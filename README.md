# CancerClassification
 This is a Cancer Cell classification program using sklearn (Scikit-Learn) to create a model to predict whether or not a given image from a fine needle aspirate sample (FNA) of a breast mass is malignant or benign. The prediction is based upon 30 characteristics from each image.
